# Building Modern React UIs (Appointment Booking System)

Hello world and happy hacking!

It's Mark, from DevmentorLive, and today we will be building the interface for an appointment booking system.

I am going to show you how unidirectional data flow works in React, and how you can share state within your component structure using the React Hooks api.

We will using clickable components and learning about modifying state from inside our click handlers, using conditional rendering and conditional styling to make our interface interactive.
